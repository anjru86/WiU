    <!-- Replace this text with your description of the project -->
    <p class="description">Surfing is a surface water sport in which the wave rider, 
    referred to as a surfer, rides on the forward or deep face of a moving wave, which is 
    usually carrying the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily
    found in the ocean, but can also be found in lakes or in rivers in the form of a 
    standing wave or tidal bore. However, surfers can also utilize man-made waves such as 
    those from boat wakes and the waves created in artificial wave pools. </b>

	The term surfing refers to the act of riding a wave, regardless of whether the wave is
	ridden with a board or without a board, and regardless of the stance used (goofy or 
	regular stance). The native peoples of the Pacific, for instance, surfed waves on 
	alaia, paipo, and other such craft, and did so on their bellies and knees. The 
	modern-day definition of surfing, however, most often refers to a surfer riding a 
	wave standing up on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing. One 
	variety of stand-up surfing is paddle boarding. Another prominent form of surfing in 
	the ocean today is body boarding, when a surfer rides a wave either on the belly, drop
	knee, or sometimes standing-up on a body board. Other types of surfing include knee 
	boarding, surf matting (riding inflatable mats), foils. Body surfing, where the wave 
	is surfed without a board, using the surfer's own body to catch and ride the wave, is 
	very common and is considered by some to be the purest form of surfing.</p>
